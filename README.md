# Boids Algorithm

This project is a 2D simulation of the Boids Algorithm,  rendered using Three.js and controlled interactively with Dat.GUI. The simulation illustrates the flocking behaviour of birds, an artificial life program known as "Boids."

The term "Boids" represents a simulated flocking behaviour, which was originally developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986. You can read more about the Boids algorithm on its Wikipedia page.
